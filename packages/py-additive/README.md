# degenscan-intel

Market-event intelligence for AI trading agents, paid per call in USDC (x402) or with an API key.

One normalized feed of price-moving events from ~40 primary sources — SEC EDGAR (8-K, Form 4, 13D), Federal Reserve, Federal Register, ECB/BoE/BoJ, FTC/DOJ/FDA/CFTC/FCC, USGS earthquakes, NOAA/NHC storms, Nasdaq halts, DefiLlama hacks, Polymarket odds, Hyperliquid perps — scored against an exposure graph into per-asset impacts (`direction`, `confidence`, `path`). Deterministic, sub-200 ms, every event links to its source document.

## 20-line trading-agent loop

```python
import os, time
from degenscan_intel import Intel

# Pick ONE:
intel = Intel(private_key=os.environ["AGENT_WALLET_PK"])   # pays USDC on Base per call via x402 (HTTP 402 -> sign -> 200)
# intel = Intel(api_key=os.environ["INTEL_API_KEY"])       # prepaid pack or Stripe plan
# intel = Intel()                                          # free trial, 100 calls/day

book = ["BTC", "ETH", "NVDA", "MSTR", "CL"]

while True:
    p = intel.pulse()                                                    # $0.001 — anything new in the last hour?
    if p["high_severity"]:
        for e in intel.events_since(since="4h", universe=book, min_confidence=0.4)["events"]:   # $0.005
            for imp in (i for i in e["impacts"] if i["asset_id"] in book and i["confidence"] >= 0.5):
                brief = intel.brief(imp["asset_id"])                     # $0.10 — pressure, headlines, filings, derivatives, catalysts
                if not brief["tradable_now"]:
                    continue                                             # venue closed -> wait for next_open
                d = intel.derivs_for(imp["asset_id"]) if imp["asset_id"] in ("BTC", "ETH") else None   # $0.003 — funding/OI/premium
                print(imp["asset_id"], "LONG" if imp["direction"] > 0 else "SHORT", imp["confidence"], e["title"], d and d["flags"])
                # -> your execution logic here
    time.sleep(3600)
```

cheap = Intel(api_key=key)                      # no per-call signatures from here on
cheap.key_status()                              # {"calls_used": ..., "calls_left": ...}

Every paid response carries `_billing: {tool, price_usd, method}`; x402 responses also carry `_payment_response` (settlement receipt with tx hash).

## How payment works (x402)

1. Agent calls a priced route → server answers **HTTP 402** with `PAYMENT-REQUIRED` (USDC on Base `eip155:8453` or Solana, amount, payTo).
2. The client (Coinbase's `x402` package) signs an EIP-3009 USDC transfer with your wallet — gas is paid by the facilitator (Coinbase CDP / PayAI).
3. The request is retried with the signature → **200** + data + `PAYMENT-RESPONSE` (tx hash).

Use a dedicated agent wallet with a few USDC. Never your main wallet.

## Reading the output

- `direction`: `1` supportive, `-1` negative, `0` unclear. `confidence` (0..1) = source tier × severity/novelty × graph-path weight — a ranking signal, **not a probability**.
- `corroboration.count` = independent sources. Primary sources (SEC, Fed, USGS) originate events; media only corroborates.
- `path` shows the exposure route, e.g. `nat.quake → facility:TSMC-Fab18 → company:TSM → company:NVDA`.
- `universe_version` is stamped on every response for reproducible backtests.

## Limits

US-equity-heavy coverage (top-100 by volume + indices), 15 crypto, main commodities/FX/rates — check `universe()`. No price data, no forecasts. Liquidations are not part of `derivs_for`. Sources marked best-effort in `sources()` may go quiet.
